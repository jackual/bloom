        <h1>Bloom</h1>
        <p>This interactive work dynamically generates an audio-visual experience inspired by the spring season that
            corresponds with analysis of movement from a live camera feed. The ambient soundtrack accompanied with
            sounds of nature create a tranquil atmosphere inviting the audience to reflect on the season. As viewers
            step into the space, their presence breathes life into the responsive blooms on display that are born and
            die infinitely, symbolising the awakening of nature and the natural rhythms of rebirth
            and growth inherent to spring. This work also explores my personal experience of synaesthesia, where in
            which the auditory and visual senses are intrinsically intertwined, allowing synaesthetes to intuitively
            illustrate audio by seeing sound or score image by hearing colour.</p>
